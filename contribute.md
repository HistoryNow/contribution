# How to
To contribute, you need to fork a repository. Forking a repository requires a Git account, and a repository will be made under your account.

First, go to the repository you want to edit.

Look here, and click fork.

Then, click "Create fork".

Make your edits, commit them to the repository, and then press Contribute --> Open Pull Request.

It may look confusing, but all you have to do is make a short one-sentence long summary of what you added in the title, and explain what you changed in the description. Finally, click "Create Pull Request". A maintainer of HistoryNow will approve or deny your pull request.

# Rules
If your pull request is denied, you are not allowed to re-create the pull request. Instead, you can make 1 (one) appeal by going to the repository you made the pull request in, and creating an issue called "APPEAL: [your reason for appealing]" and your reason in the issue description. If that is denied, you may not make an appeal or pull request for the same content.

You must not make your content biased.

Images are not allowed. Links, other than sources at the end, are not allowed.
